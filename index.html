        <p>
        I designed and developed a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS.
        The website includes sections such as Home, About, Skills, Services, Projects,
        and Contact to present my profile in a structured and professional manner.
        I focused on creating a clean layout, smooth navigation, and interactive
        user interface elements using CSS. This project helped me understand
        responsive design concepts and improve my front-end development skills.
